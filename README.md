# FPGA_LED_Matrix

FPGA driver for 32x32 RGB LED display with image display, animations, and the game of snake. The project includes debounced buttons, seven segment displays,
multiplexing circuitry to serially loads images row-by-row into on-board matrix memory, alternating memory banks, and control of game logic. ROM is used for
gamma correction and random number generation
